## Installation
This application requires a server to run on. You can use Tomcat 8.5.34 from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi). After you download the zip, add a new server in your IDE with the zip path. That will make the app run, but you cand really use it because the database probably expired.
