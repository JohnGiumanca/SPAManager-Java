# SPAManager - Java
A web application used for managing a SPA Resort with cliend and manager side interface.

## Description
Every client receives an unique acces code. He uses the code to move into another zone, for buying drinks, food or services. The SPA Resort has multiple zones, for example: Aqua Park Zone, Relaxing Zone, Sauna Zone. In every moment, the manager knows how many people are in every zone and, at the exit, he knows what products the clients bought. A client needs to buy acces to a specific zone to enter. The client knows at any moment what his shopping cart looks like and how much he needs to pay at the exit.


## Installation
This application requires a server to run on. You can use Tomcat 8.5.34 from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi). After you download the zip, add a new server in your IDE with the zip path. That will make the app run, but you can not really use it because the database probably expired.
